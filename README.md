# Music-genre-classification-using-deep-learning-models

## Overview
This repository contains code for a music genre classification model using deep learning techniques. The model is designed to classify music into different genres based on features extracted from audio recordings.

## Features
Raw wave file plot
Spectrogram visualization
Spectral roll-off analysis
Chroma feature visualization
Zero crossing rate analysis

## Dataset
The model is trained on the GTZAN dataset, which includes audio recordings from various music genres.

Experiment with different architectures such as ANN, CNN, LSTM, and ResNet for music genre classification.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy, os, pickle, librosa, tensorflow, scikit-learn, keras, IPython

## Results
The notebook provides training and validation results for each model architecture, including accuracy and loss curves. You can choose the model architecture that best suits your requirements. The best accuracy is obtained through ANN only.

Feel free to experiment with hyperparameter tuning and explore different deep learning architectures to improve the model's performance.

Credits
This project is based on the GTZAN dataset, and the code is adapted from various sources in the field of music genre classification.
